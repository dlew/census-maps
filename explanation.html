<h1>Explanation</h1>
<p>Some anticipated questions & answers.<p>
<h2>Lacking Browser Support</h2>
<p>If this doesn't work on your favorite browser, then too bad.  I made this for fun so I could see the data.  I guarantee it will work in Chrome because that's what I'm using.</p>
<h2>"Females 16 years and over"?  You must be fun at parties.</h2>
<p>That's what the census labels that data!  All the odd phrasings come straight from the actual census data.<p>
<h2>Missing Neighborhoods</h2>
<p>There's no data for Sumner-Glenwood and Downtown East, so they are not represented on the map.</p>
<h2>Data Sources</h2>
<p>Neighborhood boundaries are based on <a href="http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/about/maps/neighborhoods.pdf">this map</a>.  Minneapolis neighborhood census data is from <a href="http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/citywork/planning/Census2000/maps/economic/">here</a>.</p>
